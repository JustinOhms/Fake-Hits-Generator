## Sorry!. I'm shutting down this project due to following reasons.
- The IDE this project was originally developed with is no longer maintained.
- Codebase is highly outdated and doesn't work well on newer Windows versions.
- There are new bugs that can't be fixed due to these limitations.
- I don't have time to build this from scratch & I no longer work with Visual Basic programming language. 
- I'm planning to redo this entire project using Java in the future.
